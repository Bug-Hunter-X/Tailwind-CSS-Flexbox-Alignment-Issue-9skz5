# Tailwind CSS Flexbox Alignment Issue
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS with flexbox.  The provided code snippet shows two boxes, one red and one blue, that should align side by side, but the result is unexpected. The solution file provides the fix and an explanation.

## Bug Description
The two divs are expected to align horizontally due to `flex` class. However, they may stack vertically or exhibit other unexpected behavior. This might happen due to missing or conflicting Tailwind classes affecting the layout.

## Solution
The solution explains the likely causes (e.g., missing parent container styling, incorrect class usage, or unintended styles from other CSS) and shows the correct approach using Tailwind utilities for proper alignment.
